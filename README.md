📖 Bible Notes — Obsidian Vault

This repository contains my personal Bible study notes organised using Obsidian. The vault is structured for long-term study, clarity, and continuous growth. Each book of the Bible has its own folder, and each chapter is stored as an individual note.

The notes include:
Chapter summaries

Verse-by-verse commentary

Cross-references (internal Obsidian links across books and chapters)

Themes, symbolism, and theological observations

Applications and reflections

Space for ongoing revision as new insights develop

Each chapter note follows a consistent structure:

Verse-by-verse notes

Cross references

Themes & observations

Applications / personal reflections

This consistency makes the vault easy to navigate and expand.

🔗 Cross-Referencing

Obsidian’s linking system is used throughout to connect verses, themes, and parallels across Scripture.

Examples:

    See [[John 3#3:16]] in connection with [[Numbers 21#9]].

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this vault is to build a structured, deeply interconnected study resource that grows over time. Scripture is explored thoughtfully, with connections highlighted across books, themes, and contexts.

This is a living project — notes will continue to expand and develop as study progresses.
