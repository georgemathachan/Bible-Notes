###### Genesis 4:1
Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord.”
###### Genesis 4:2
And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.

Both vocations are good. The problem that follows is not _what_ Cain does, but _how_ he relates to God within it.
###### Genesis 4:3
In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground,
###### Genesis 4:4
and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering,
###### Genesis 4:5
but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.

Abel brings the **first and best**; Cain brings _something_. Scripture never says Cain’s offering was evil - only that it lacked the wholeheartedness of Abel’s. God desires not mere ritual, but the heart behind it.
###### Genesis 4:6
The Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?
###### Genesis 4:7
If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.”
###### Genesis 4:8
Cain said to Abel his brother, “Let us go out to the field.” And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.

This is the first act of human violence - and it is fratricide. Sin that is not mastered turns outward, destroying communion with others.
###### Genesis 4:9
Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?”
###### Genesis 4:10
And the Lord said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to me from the ground.
###### Genesis 4:11
And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
###### Genesis 4:12
When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”

Cain’s lie mirrors Adam’s evasion. The ground - once a place of vocation—now becomes a witness against him. Violence breaks humanity’s relationship with both God and creation.
###### Genesis 4:13
Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.
###### Genesis 4:14
Behold, thou hast driven me this day away from the ground; and from thy face I shall be hidden; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will slay me.”
###### Genesis 4:15
Then the Lord said to him, “Not so! If any one slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the Lord put a mark on Cain, lest any who came upon him should kill him.

Even here, God limits violence. The mark of Cain is not a sign of abandonment, but of **restrained justice**. Mercy still interrupts the spiral of death.
###### Genesis 4:16
Then Cain went away from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
###### Genesis 4:17
Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
###### Genesis 4:18
To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Me-hu′ja-el, and Me-hu′ja-el the father of Me-thu′sha-el, and Me-thu′sha-el the father of Lamech.
###### Genesis 4:19
And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
###### Genesis 4:20
Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle.
###### Genesis 4:21
His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
###### Genesis 4:22
Zillah bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Na′amah.
###### Genesis 4:23
Lamech said to his wives:

“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;  
    you wives of Lamech, hearken to what I say:  
I have slain a man for wounding me,  
    a young man for striking me.
###### Genesis 4:24
If Cain is avenged sevenfold,  
    truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”

Human culture develops—cities, music, metallurgy—but moral decay accelerates alongside it. Lamech’s boast shows violence becoming normalised and glorified.
###### Genesis 4:25
And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, “God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.”
###### Genesis 4:26
To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time men began to call upon the name of the Lord.

Despite sin, death, and exile, worship returns. The line of hope continues. God’s plan is not extinguished by human failure.



## General Notes (Genesis 4)

#### Theology

- God desires offerings given with sincerity and priority, not mere obligation.
- Divine justice is always tempered by mercy.

#### Anthropology / Humanity

- Unchecked resentment can become violence.
- Humans are responsible not only for personal holiness but for one another.

#### Sin & Moral Development

- Sin escalates: jealousy → anger → murder → cultural glorification of violence.
- God warns before He judges.

#### Creation / Vocation

- Work is meant to be life-giving; sin distorts vocation into frustration and exile.

#### Literary Structure

- The chapter moves from family → worship → violence → society → hope.
- Lamech’s song is a dark parody of God’s justice.

#### Prayer / Spiritual Reflection

- Am I giving God my **first and best**, or only what is left over?
- Do I address resentment early, or allow it to grow?

#### Covenant / Salvation History

- Seth represents continuity of God’s promise after apparent failure.
- Worship re-emerges even in a fallen world.
