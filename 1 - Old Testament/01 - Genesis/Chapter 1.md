###### Genesis 1:1

The word created used here is the Hebrew word bara (בָּרָא) which is not found anywhere else in the Bible. It means creation out of nothing.

God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.

###### Genesis 1:12
The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
###### Genesis 1:13

###### Genesis 1:15
and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so.
###### Genesis 1:16

###### Genesis 1:17

###### Genesis 1:23
And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
###### Genesis 1:24
And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.
###### Genesis 1:25
And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
###### Genesis 1:26
Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”

The only worldview where we are made in God's image and likeness. This is where we get our dignity from. We don't get it from our beauty, power or strength. From the government or any other source other than the fact that every human being is made in the image and likeness of God.
###### Genesis 1:27
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
###### Genesis 1:28
And God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.”

And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.
###### Genesis 1:30
And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.
###### Genesis 1:31
And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.


### General Notes
We cannot these early chapters of Genesis wrong - if we get these wrong then we will get the entire Bible, the story of salvation, trajectory of the Western civilisation wrong. That's not to say there aren't other creation stories around but Genesis 1 is unique. Other creation stories are more often that not, born out of violence or evil. The CCC teaches "God infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness, freely created man to share in his own blessed life". The CCC asserts what the Bible asserts. God created us not to be his slaves or pawns but to share in his own blessed life.
We do not **need** to take this Chapter literally.
