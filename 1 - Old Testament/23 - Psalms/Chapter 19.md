###### Psalms 1:1
The heavens are telling the glory of God;  
    and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
###### Psalms 1:2
Day to day pours forth speech,  
    and night to night declares knowledge.
###### Psalms 1:3
There is no speech, nor are there words;  
    their voice is not heard;
###### Psalms 1:4
yet their voice goes out through all the earth,  
    and their words to the end of the world.
 In them he has set a tent for the sun,
###### Psalms 1:5
which comes forth like a bridegroom leaving his chamber,  
    and like a strong man runs its course with joy.
###### Psalms 1:6
Its rising is from the end of the heavens,  
    and its circuit to the end of them;  
    and there is nothing hid from its heat.
###### Psalms 1:7
The law of the Lord is perfect,  
    reviving the soul;  
the testimony of the Lord is sure,  
    making wise the simple;
###### Psalms 1:8
the precepts of the Lord are right,  
    rejoicing the heart;  
the commandment of the Lord is pure,  
    enlightening the eyes;
###### Psalms 1:9
the fear of the Lord is clean,  
    enduring for ever;  
the ordinances of the Lord are true,  
    and righteous altogether.
###### Psalms 1:10
More to be desired are they than gold,  
    even much fine gold;  
sweeter also than honey  
    and drippings of the honeycomb.
###### Psalms 1:11
Moreover by them is thy servant warned;  
    in keeping them there is great reward.
###### Psalms 1:12
But who can discern his errors?  
    Clear thou me from hidden faults.
###### Psalms 1:13
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins;  
    let them not have dominion over me!  
Then I shall be blameless,  
    and innocent of great transgression.
###### Psalms 1:14
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart  
    be acceptable in thy sight,  
    O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
